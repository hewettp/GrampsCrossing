# GrampsCrossing

This utility is intended to optimise the layout of a relationship graph produced with Gramps (genealogy software).

The relationship graph uses graphviz to produce charts, but for large or complex graphs, layout is not optimised and is sensitive to the order of the input data. This utility iterates the order of individual items in the input file to minimise the number of crossings in the output chart.
